        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, I'm [Your Name], a self-taught Front-end Developer. I'm on an exciting journey of self-discovery in the
          world of web development, driven by a strong passion for creating engaging and user-friendly websites and
          applications.</p>
    
        <p>Before my transition to web development, I had the privilege of serving as an instructor at the Institute of
          Computer Engineering Technology, where I had the opportunity to share my knowledge and passion for technology with
          aspiring students. This experience not only enriched my understanding of the field but also ignited my desire to
          take my own path in web development.</p>
    
        <p>As an instructor, I cultivated the skills necessary to convey complex concepts in a clear and understandable
          manner, which I now apply in crafting intuitive and user-friendly web experiences.</p>
    
        <p>While I may not have formal industry experience or a degree in computer science, my determination and dedication
          to learning have been my greatest assets. I've spent countless hours exploring the intricacies of web development,
          experimenting with coding, and solving real-world problems through self-guided projects.</p>
